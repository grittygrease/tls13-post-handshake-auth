--- abstract

This document describes a mechanism for performing post-handshake
certificate-based authentication in Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.3
and later. This includes both spontaneous and elicited authentication of both
client and server.

# Introduction

This document defines a way to authenticate one party of a Transport Layer
Security (TLS) communication to another using a certificate after the session
has been established. This allows both the client and server elicit proof of
ownership of additional identities at any time after the handshake has
completed. It also allows for both the client and server to spontaneously
provide a certificate and proof of ownership of the private key to the other
party.

This mechanism is useful in the following situations:

* servers that have the ability to serve requests from multiple domains over the
  same connection but do not have a certificate that is simultaneously
  authoritative over all of them

* servers that have resources that require client authentication to access and
  need to request client authentication after the connection has started

* clients that want to assert their identity to a server after a connection has
  been established

* clients that want a server to re-prove ownership of their private key during a
  connection

* clients that wish to ask a server to authenticate for a new domain not covered
  by the certificate included in the initial handshake

This document intends to replace the use of renegotiation for changing the
authentication of peers. It has an advantage over renegotiation in that it only
takes at most one round trip and it does not include an additional key exchange.

This document describes spontaneous and solicited modes for both client and
server authentication. Spontaneous authentication allows an endpoint to
advertise a certificate without explicitly being requested.  Solicited
authentication allows an endpoint to request that its peer provide
authentication details.

Support for different modes of authentication is negotiated using a new
`post_handshake_auth` extension.  New handshake messages are defined for use
after completion of the initial handshake, these mirror the authentication
messages that are used in the TLS 1.3 handshake.


# Post-Handshake Authentication

There is a total of four different exchanges that are enabled by this
specification.  Solicited and spontaneous authentication exchanges are largely
the same for both peers.  This section describes how each exchange operates.

In all cases, a unique value for the certificate_request_context is chosen.
This allows for identification of the authentication flow in application
protocols that use TLS.  Exchanges that are initiated by the client start with
an octet that has the most significant bit set; exchanges initiated by the
server have the most significant bit cleared.


## Spontaneous Authentication

An endpoint that wishes to offer spontaneous authentication sends a Certificate,
CertificateVerify, and Finished message.

~~~
  Certificate
  CertificateVerify
  Finished              ---------->
~~~

No application data records or any other handshake messages can be interleaved
with these messages.  An endpoint MUST abort a connection if it does not receive
these messages in a contiguous sequence.  A fatal `unexpected_message` alert
SHOULD be sent if these messages do not appear in sequence.

A client MUST NOT initiate spontaneous authentication unless the server included
client_auth_spontaneous in its `post_handshake_auth` extension.  Similarly, a
server MUST NOT initiate spontaneous authentication unless it included
server_auth_solicited in its `post_handshake_auth` extension.


## Solicited Authentication

Solicited authentication is initiated by sending a CertificateRequest message.

Endpoints that request that their peer authenticate need to account for delays
in processing requests.  In particular, client authentication in some contexts
relies on user interaction.  This means that responses might not arrive in the
order in which the requests were made.

If a request for authentication is accepted, the sequence of Certificate,
CertificateVerify, and Finished messages are sent by the responding peer.  As
with spontaneous authentication, these messages MUST form a contiguous sequence.

~~~
  CertificateRequest    ---------->
                                           Certificate
                                     CertificateVerify
                        <----------           Finished
~~~


A request for authentication can be rejected by sending a Certificate message
that contains an empty certificate_list field.  The extensions field of this
message MUST be empty.

A client MUST NOT request server authentication unless the server included
client_auth_solicited in its `post_handshake_auth` extension.  Similarly, a
server MUST NOT request client authentication unless it included
client_auth_solicited in its `post_handshake_auth` extension.


# Post-Handshake Authentication TLS Extension

The `post_handshake_auth` TLS extension advertises support for post-handshake
authentication.

~~~
    enum {
        client_auth_solicited(0),
        client_auth_spontaneous(1),
        server_auth_solicited(2),
        server_auth_spontaneous(3),
        (255)
    } AuthTypes;

    struct {
        AuthType auth_types<0..2^8-1>;
        select (Role) {
            case server:
                SignatureScheme signature_algorithms<2..2^16-2>;
        }
    } PostHandshakeAuth;
~~~

The extension data for the `post_handshake_auth` extension is PostHandshakeAuth.
This includes one or more AuthType.  Each AuthType value represents support for
a given authentication flow:

client_auth_solicited:
: indicates support for client authentication solicited by a server request

client_auth_spontaneous:
: indicates support for spontaneous client authentication

server_auth_solicited:
: indicates support for server authentication solicited by a client request

server_auth_spontaneous:
: indicates support for spontaneous server authentication

The client includes a `post_handshake_auth` extension containing every type of
authentication flow it supports in its ClientHello. The server replies with an
EncryptedExtensions containing a `post_handshake_auth` extension containing a
list of authentication types and the list of signature schemes supported. The
set of AuthTypes in the serverâ€™s `post_handshake_auth` extension MUST be a
subset of the set sent by the client. The extension MAY be omitted if the server
does not support any form of post-handshake authentication.

If a server supports either form of client authentication (client_auth_solicited
or client_auth_spontaneous), it MUST also include a "signature_algorithms"
extension (see Section 4.2.2 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}) containing a list of supported
signature schemes. This contains a list of the signature algorithms that the
server is able to verify, listed in descending order of preference.


# Post-Handshake Authentication Messages

The messages used for post-handshake authentication closely mirror those used to
authenticate certificates in the standard TLS handshake.


## Certificate Request

For elicited post-handshake authentication, the first message is used to define
the characteristics required in the elicited certificate.

~~~
    opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;

    struct {
        opaque certificate_extension_oid<1..2^8-1>;
        opaque certificate_extension_values<0..2^16-1>;
    } CertificateExtension;

    struct {
        opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
        select (Role) {
            case server:
                DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<0..2^16-1>;
                CertificateExtension certificate_extensions<0..2^16-1>;
            case client:
                HostName host_name<1..2^16-1>;
        }
    } CertificateRequest;
~~~

The certificate_request_context is an opaque string which identifies the
certificate request and which will be echoed in the corresponding Certificate
message. The certificate_request_context value MUST be unique for the
connection. A client MUST set the most significant bit of the first octet of the
certificate_request_context; a server MUST clear this bit.

For CertificateRequests sent from the server, the DistinguishedName and
CertificateExtension fields are defined exactly as in the TLS 1.3
specification.

For CertificateRequests send from the client, a HostName containing the Server
Name Indication (defined in [RFC6066]) used for selecting the certificate is
included.


## Certificate Message

The certificate message is used to transport the certificate. It mirrors the
Certificate message in the TLS with the addition of some certificate-specific
extensions.

~~~
    opaque ASN1Cert<1..2^24-1>;

    struct {
        opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
        ASN1Cert certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
        Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
    } Certificate;
~~~

certificate_request_context:
: If this message is in response to a CertificateRequest, the value of
  certificate_request_context in that message.

certificate_list:
: This is a sequence (chain) of certificates. The sender's end entity
  certificate MUST come first in the list. Each following certificate SHOULD
  directly certify one preceding it. Because certificate validation requires
  that trust anchors be distributed independently, a certificate that specifies
  a trust anchor MAY be omitted from the chain, provided that supported peers
  are known to possess any omitted certificates.

extensions:
: Valid extensions include OCSP Status extensions ({{!RFC6066}} and
  {{!RFC6961}}) and SignedCertificateTimestamps ({{!RFC6962}}). Any extension
  presented in a Certificate message must only be presented if the associated
  ClientHello extension was presented in the initial handshake.

The certificate_request_context is an opaque string that identifies the
certificate. The certificate_request_context value MUST be unique for the
connection. If the certificate is used in response to a CertificateRequest,
certificate_request_context includes the certificate_request_context value in
the corresponding CertificateRequest. If the Certificate message part of
spontaneous authentication, the certificate_request_context value is chosen by
the sender.  When spontaneous authentication is used, a client MUST set the most
significant bit of the first octet of the certificate_request_context; a server
MUST clear this bit.

Any certificates provided MUST be signed using a signature scheme found in the
"signature_algorithms" extension provided by the peer in the initial
handshake. The end entity certificate MUST allow the key to be used for signing
(i.e., the digitalSignature bit MUST be set if the Key Usage extension is
present) with a signature scheme indicated in the "signature_algorithms"
extension provided by the peer in the initial handshake.


## CertificateVerify Message

The CertificateVerify message used in this document is defined in Section
4.3.2. of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.

~~~
    struct {
        SignatureScheme algorithm;
        opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
    } CertificateVerify;
~~~

The algorithm field specifies the signature algorithm used (see Section 4.2.2 of
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}). The signature is a digital signature using that
algorithm that covers the hash output:

~~~
    Hash(Handshake Context + Certificate) + Hash(resumption_context)
~~~

The Handshake context and Base Key are defined in the following table:

| Mode | Handshake Context | Base Key |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Spontaneous Authentication | ClientHello ... ClientFinished | traffic_secret_N |
| Elicited Authentication | ClientHello ... ClientFinished + CertificateRequest | traffic_secret_N |

## Finished Message

Finished is a MAC over the value:

~~~
    Hash(Handshake Context + Certificate + CertificateVerify) +
        Hash(resumption_context)
~~~

The Finished message uses the same MAC key that is used in TLS 1.3, see Section
4.3.3 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.


# Security Considerations

TBD


## Interaction With Resumption

Certificate identity should not be maintained across resumption. If a connection
is resumed, additional certificate identities for both client and server
certificates should be forgotten.
